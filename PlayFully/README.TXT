PROJECT TITLE: PlayFully
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Build a reflection of real world skilling
VERSION or DATE: 11-9-14 (last updated on)
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Look around; If anyone likes front end and wants to build a gui for this bulky unweildy thing that would be awesome
AUTHORS: Paz Zait-Givon
USER INSTRUCTIONS:


This project is an expirament in gamification.
Currently implemented features are:
    Basic stats and leveling functionality (both upwards and downwards)
    Basic idea of how accounts, teams, dependants, quests, and questlines might be handled
Planned features include:
        file input and output (save files)
        analysis of how you allocate your time and energy
        A graphical user interface (eventually... this will probably come very very late)
        an automated and human written history called an adventure log (it would be great if we could add pictures too! after the gui...)
        Accounts with teams which may include dependants and hierarchy systems that interact with each other
        Questlines
